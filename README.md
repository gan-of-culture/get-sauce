# go-hentai-scraper

Is a commandline tool to download hentai made in go by me. You can see what site is supported in what extent down below.

**[Notice]** This repo is still heavily work in progress - so stuff can change

This will be part of another project I have planned so stay tuned.

## Setup guide

Download the right release under the releases tab.

You can clone this Repository youself and download it. Then just do:

```bash
go build
```

After that you should be provided with a **executable**.

Or you can just do

```bash
go run main.go ...
```

## Options

```console

*Note that I currently didn't find a way to download 1080p hentai from hanime.tv and implenting 720p isn't that high on my list - I'll try to find a way in the future*  

*Note exhentai is currently not supported, because it requires a user login and I don't want my user banned - I'll probably add a way to extract the data with your own user and a manual how to get one*

If your site is not listed - you can still try to use the universal downloader
This works really good for the pitures of hanime.tv

## Teach me

I am fairly new to programming in golang. Any tipps and changes that help me develop myself and this repo are highly appriciated.

## TODO's

- Clean up coding and add more sites
- Really just follow this repo to see what I am up to

## Licencse

Pretty sure [MIT](LICENSE) is the way to go
