# go-hentai-scraper

Is a commandline tool to download hentai made in go by me. You can see what site is supported in what extent down below.

**[Notice]** This repo is still heavily work in progress - so stuff can change

This will be the base for another project I have planned so stay tuned.

## Setup guide

For now you need to clone the repo youself and download it. Then just do `go build`.
After that you should be provided with a executable. Or you can just do `go run main.go ...` instead.

I'll do proper releases later *probably~*

*Note that I currently didn't find a way to download 1080p hentai from hanime.tv and implenting 720p isn't that high on my list - I'll try to find a way in the future*

## Teach me

I am fairly new to programming in golang. Any tipps and changes that help me develop myself and this repo are highly appriciated.

## TODO's

- Clean up coding and add more sites.
- Really just follow this repo to see what I am up to

## Licencse

Pretty sure [MIT](LICENSE) is the way to go
